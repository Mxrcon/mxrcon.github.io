These are tools which I've put together over the years. With the execption to Staphopia (*v2 is in the works!*) all my tools are available on Bioconda. Currently, most of my effort is going towards [Bactopia](https://bactopia.github.io/). So, if you try Bactopia, I would love to get any feedback you might have!

But that goes for the others too! If you use any of my tools and have feedback or run into a bug, please create an issue on their respective GitHub repository. I will try my best to help in any way that I can!
