I'm a bioinformatician focused on bacterial pathogens and workflow development. Over the last 10+ years I have developed many  bioinformatic tools that have been used by thousands of users. I am active in the bioinformatic community and contribute my expertise regularly to open-source projects, such as BioConda. My expertise has also allowed me the opportunity to act as the primary bioinformatician for many research projects, as well as receiving funding from multiple awards.
