I am a bioinformatician focused on bacterial pathogens and workflow development. Over the last 10+ years I have developed bioinformatic tools that have been used by thousands of users. I am an active member of the bioinformatic community and contribute my expertise regularly to open-source projects, such as [Bioconda](https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes/pulls?q=is%3Apr+involves%3Arpetit3+is%3Aclosed). My expertise has also allowed me to act as the lead bioinformatician for many research projects, as well as receiving funding from multiple awards.
