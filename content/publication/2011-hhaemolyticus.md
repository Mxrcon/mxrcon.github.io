abstract = "We report the first whole-genome sequences for five strains, two carried and three pathogenic, of the emerging pathogen *Haemophilus haemolyticus*. Preliminary analyses indicate that these genome sequences encode markers that distinguish *H. haemolyticus* from its closest *Haemophilus* relatives and provide clues to the identity of its virulence factors."
