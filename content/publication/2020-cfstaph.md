abstract = "*Staphylococcus aureus* has recently overtaken *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* as the most commonly recognized bacterial pathogen that infects the respiratory tracts of individuals with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis (CF) in the United States. Most studies of *S. aureus* in CF patient lung infections have focused on a few isolates, often exclusively laboratory-adapted strains, and how they are killed by *P. aeruginosa* Less is known about the diversity of *S. aureus* CF patient lung isolates in terms of both their virulence and their interaction with *P. aeruginosa* To begin to address this gap, we recently sequenced 64 clinical *S. aureus* isolates and a reference isolate, JE2. Here, we analyzed the antibiotic resistance genotypes, sequence types, clonal complexes, spa types, agr types, and presence/absence of other known virulence factor genes of these isolates. We hypothesized that virulence phenotypes of *S. aureus*, namely, toxin production and the mucoid phenotype, would be lost in these isolates due to adaptation in the CF patient lung. In contrast to these expectations, we found that most isolates can lyse both rabbit and sheep blood (67.7%) and produce polysaccharide (69.2%), suggesting that these phenotypes were not lost during adaptation to the CF lung. We also identified three distinct phenotypic groups of *S. aureus* based on their survival in the presence of nonmucoid *P. aeruginosa* laboratory strain PAO1 and its mucoid derivative. Altogether, our work provides greater insight into the diversity of *S. aureus* isolates from CF patients, specifically the distribution of important virulence factors and their interaction with *P. aeruginosa*, all of which have implications in patient health."
