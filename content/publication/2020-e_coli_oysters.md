abstract = "Concentration of bacterial species indicative of fecal contamination in the gut of mangrove oysters (Crassostrea gasar) is a major concern for public health and food surveillance. Our work aimed to determine the occurrence, antibiotic-resistance, phylogenetic profile and virulence of Escherichia coli strains isolated from C. gasar farmed in four estuaries of Amazonia. Santo Antônio de Urindeua was the sampling point with the highest number of E. coli cells in oyster samples (104 per 100 g of sample). Twenty-four isolates (52.2%) showed resistance to cephalotin and 18 to amoxicillin (39.1%). Eighteen clonal populations were determined by rep-PCR and were mainly affiliated to the pathogenic and commensal phylo-groups B1 and D. The presence of elt genes suggests that 10 of these clones belong to the Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli pathotype. Plasmids, mostly of the F incompatibility group, were detected in the majority of the strains. All isolates were susceptible to last-resort antibiotics."
