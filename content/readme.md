### Yo! 👋

Yep, I'm using a theme that looks exactly like GitHub's! I stumbled upon it while [browsing Hugo themes](https://themes.gohugo.io/github-style/). I figured since I spend a lot of time browsing GitHub, I'd use it, and with some modifications, here we are! Now with that out the way...

Welcome and thank you for stopping by! I'm Robert and I currently work as a bioinformatician in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Emory University. My work involves further developing [Bactopia](https://bactopia.github.io/), a bacterial genome analysis pipeline, and providing bioinformatic support for the [EMERGENT Group](https://read-lab-confederation.github.io/) and collaborators.

- 💻 Things I use daily: [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/), [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/), Unix, Python
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)
- 💬 Ask me about: [Bactopia](https://bactopia.github.io/) and [Bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/)
- 🛠️ Bug or feedback? Please submit a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/rpetit3/robertpetit.com/issues/new) (*thank you!*)
