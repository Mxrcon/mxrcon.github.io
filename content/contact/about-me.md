Let's see where to start? I grew up in the military, so its kind of hard to point at a location and say
"*this is where I'm from*". But, if I had to pick one I would say Georgia (USA)! Haha I have lived here more
than 20 years! 

I completed my undergrad at [Valdosta State University](https://www.valdosta.edu/) in Biology (2010). Fun fact, 
I changed my major so many times (*6+*), it was quite the winding path! I did however meet my wife
during one of the majors (Middle Grades Education), so it all worked out! After undergrad, 
I wound up in Atlanta, Georgia at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/). I was accepted into the 
[Bioinformatics Gradaute Program](https://bioinformatics.gatech.edu/) program, where I worked with 
King Jordan and Tim Read. After completing the Masters in Bioinformatics (2011) I joined Tim Read's lab as 
Bioinformatician and soon joined the [Population Biology, Ecology, and Evolution (PBEE)](http://www.biomed.emory.edu/PROGRAM_SITES/PBEE/index.html) 
program at Emory University where I received by PhD (2018). During my PhD I got to work on some 
really exciting including the Whale Shark genome, MRSA transmission within households, *B. anthracis* typing, and 
Staphopia. Currently, I'm still at Emory as a research scientist.

When I'm not trying to this science thing, I love spending time with the kids! Haha the boys are getting
to the age where we can be trouble makers together! Otherwise I'll be reading a book, fixing something
(*stares at the kids*), or building something.
