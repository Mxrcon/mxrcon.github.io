I received my PhD in [Population Biology, Ecology, and Evolution (PBEE)](http://www.biomed.emory.edu/PROGRAM_SITES/PBEE/index.html) 
from Emory University in 2018. During my PhD, I developed [Staphopia](https://staphopia.emory.edu) 
a pipeline and database with genomic results for more than [40,000 *Staphylococcus aureus* 
genomes](https://peerj.com/articles/5261/). You know what's even better!? People around the world are still 
using Staphopia, which is super exciting!

My latest workflow baby is [Bactopia](https://bactopia.github.io/), the successor to Staphopia's analysis workflow. 
Bactopia, built with the [Nextflow platform](https://www.nextflow.io/), provides efficient comparative genomic 
analysis for any bacterial species or genus. My goal with Bactopia is to help you process your data with a broad set 
of tools, so that you can get to the fun part quicker!

Aside from [Staphopia](https://staphopia.emory.edu) and [Bactopia](https://bactopia.github.io/), I am also a big advocate for making bioinformatics more accessible to others. The days of slogging through installations should be long gone for everyone! To help in this effort, I have contributed multiple recipes to [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/) and [Bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/contributor/index.html).
