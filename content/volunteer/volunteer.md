Now that we have package managers, such as [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/), the days of slogging though installations should be a thing of the past! To help make this a reality, I try my best to regularly submit tools to [Bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/). When possible I also try to contribute in the form of pull requests or commenting on issues with a solution.  Below are a list of some contributions I have made.
