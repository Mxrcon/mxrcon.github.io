Staphopia is a database focusing on the genomes of the bacterial pathogen Staphylococcus aureus. 
Life-threatening Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) infections strike across our society, both 
in the community and hospital settings. In recent years whole genome shotgun sequencing of clinical 
isolates has become common. As of August 2017 there were over 44,000 publicly available S. aureus 
sequencing projects in EBI's ENA database. Staphopia aims to provide rapid analysis of these 
whole-genome datasets as well as useful S. aureus specific results, such as genotype, antibiotic 
resistance and virulence gene profiles.
